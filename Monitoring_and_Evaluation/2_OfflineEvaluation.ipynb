(1) the presumption from recent possession of stolen property is an optional prescription of fact under section 114 of the indian evidence act. it is open to the court to convict the appellant by using the presumption when the circumstances indicate that no other reasonable hypothesis except the guilty knowledge of the appellant is open to the prosecution. [751 d] (2) in the instant case, there was no mention of the appellant 's name in the f.i.r. there was no change under s 411, i.p.c. against him and he was not asked to explain it possession of the truck, but still he did explain it. the appellant 's answer to the omnibus question under section 342, criminal procedure code, without giving him an intimation of the offence of which he was likely to be convicted, on the face of it, was quite reasonable and credible. the prosecution had been unable to repel the effect of this fairly acceptable explanation. the explanation which the appellant had given was good enough to raise serious doubts about the susceptibility of a charge under section 411, indian penal code. the principle of benefit of doubt on questions of fact applies whether the verdict is of a jury or the finding is to be given by a judge or a magistrate.[751,ab.e h] otto george gfeller vs the king, air 1943 pc 211 @ 214 \n",

a. i do not know whether m/lorry no. mrs 7372 was handed over to the complainant on sale purchase agreement and that the complainant had paid rs. 43,000/ towards the instalment. i do not know whether the price was fixed at rs. 50,000/ . balwant singh is my brother but i do not know if the complainant had given lorry in his possession in his capacity as a driver. i do not know whether balwant singh left with m/lorry in dec. 1967. i do not know anything about balwant singh not meeting the complainant thereafter. mangal singh told me that this lorry had met with an accident and that i should invest the amount over repair, and after the amount is recovered from the plying of the lorry, the lorry would be returned to him. it is true that vazir singh and one p.c. had told me to take the lorry at the pydhonie police stn. i was the driver on the said vehicle at that time. i do not know where is my brother at present. he meets me at times. i have not spoken to him about the case. i want to lead defence witness\". he led some evidence in defence. mangaldas purshottam, d.w. 1, stated that,one kartar singh the driver of the truck had sent him a trunk call from jalan that the truck in question had met with an accident on 4 3 1968 and that he gave this message to section d. sutar. as the accident was serious and the damage was considerable 750 section d. sutar was unable to meet with the money required to repair it. according to vazir singh, pw 2, the claim against insurance co. was of rs.,11000/ . according to mangaldas, dw 1, the complainant had agreed that the appellant should repair the truck and deduct its expenses out of the income he could make from plying the truck on hire. he proved exhibit 1 dated 12 3 1968 containing a writing, signed by section d. sutar. it has been translated as follows: \"ext. '1 ' dated 12 3 1968. national india roadways, \"i, shankar dhondiba give you in writing today that my lorry no. mrs 7372 which had met with an accident, i am bound to pay total costs whatever comes to of its reparation\". sd./ shankar dhondiba sutar\". this was put to section d. sutar in cross examination. he admitted his signature under the writing and gave no explanation about it. it is significant that it was executed on the very day on which, according to an admission of section d. sutar, balwant singh also saw section d. sutar. perhaps the defence has also yet come out with the whole truth. it is, however, quite inconceivable that section d. sutar would be completely unconcerned as to what had happen to the truck if he had not entrusted it to somebody other than balwantsingh uttamsingh for repairs to it. the matter seems to have been report ed to the police only as a result of some quarrel or differences between parties. moreover, nobody would repair the truck without being paid for it. the explanation given by the appellant was, on the face of it, quite reasonable and credible. it was not merely supported by mangaldas purshottarn, d.w.l, whose cross examination did not elicit anything to show that he was unreliable but also, indirectly, by ashok jugannath, dw2, the superintendent of the commonwealth insurance co. `who proved the bills supplied to the company on the strength of which the insurance co. had paid rs. 6078.35. it was, therefore, clear that somebody had got the truck repaired and realised the amounts to be paid for repairs from the insurance company. the beneficiary of the contract of insurance was the bombay ex servicemen transport co. of which section d. sutar was a member. apparently, the amount had been realised by somebody on behalf of this company. the bills could have been given by the appellant. in the absence of any proof as to who else could have or had repaired the truck the version of the appellant could not be said to be quite unbelievable. 751 a remarkable part of the case is that the trying magistrate had a convicted the appellant under section 411 indian penal code and sentenced him to six months rigorous imprisonment and to pay a fine of rs., 500/ when he was not even charged with this offence. , the high court had maintained this conviction and the sentence and had not even mentioned the defects in the trial. there was neither a charge under section 411 i.p.c. nor was the appellant asked to explain his possession of the truck although he did account for it. the appellant 's explanation appeared quite plausible. it may have been difficult to hold that the appellant could not have been prejudiced by the omission to frame a charge or by the manner in which he was put one omnibus question under section 342 criminal procedure code without giving him an intimation of the offence of which he was likely to be convicted, if these questions had been seriously raised. however, as these questions do not appear to have been argued in the high court and were`not even raised in the grounds of appeal in this court, we will not consider them further. we think that this appeal is bound to succeed on the view of the facts we have taken above. the presumption from recent possession of stolen property is an optional presumption of fact under section 114 indian evidence act. it is open to the court to convict an appellant by using the presumption where the circumstances indicate that no other reasonable hypothesis except the guilty knowledge of the appellant is open to the prosecution. in the case before us, the appellant had given a fairly acceptable explanations. the prosecution had been unable to repel the effect of it. the owner of the truck, section d. sutar, had made admissions which indicated that the prosecution case of an unlawful possession on the part of the appellant was not likely. it is more likely that the appellant had been entrusted with the truck in order that he might repair it and realise the costs. however, we express no opinion on this aspect of the matter as the sentence of such a contract may involve a civil liability. all we need say is that the explanation which the appellant had given was good enough to raise serious doubts about the sustainability of a charge under section 411 indian penal c\n",

[285f] the court, including the apex one is a part of the state and is a built in mechanism of the constitution to administer justice in accordance with law. for discharging that duty, the court has got to adopt an attitude of critical assessment of situations connected with litigation brought before it for adjudication. the manner of functioning of the court in accord with the rule of law has to be dispassionate, objective and analytical. the judges who preside over these courts do not act with a sense of superiority; nor do they look down upon others in the community. [285f g] in order that the system may efficiently work and the purpose for which the courts are established is duly served, it is necessary that everyone within the framework of the rule of law must accept the system, render due obedience to orders made and in the event of failure of compliance, the rod of justice must descend down to punish. everyone within the system must realise this situation and should not unnecessarily get into a confrontation. [285h; 286a b] in the instant case, there is some material which if probed into further, might have established that respondent no. 6 had notice of the order of this court before physical dispossession of the petitioner was effected. there is allegation of adoption of an attitude of resentment by respondent no. 6 or for the matter of that the local officers, when the writ petition was filed in this court. that backdrop could supply the motive for the delay in complying with the directions of this court. it is, however, not considered expedient to probe further into the matter on account of the fact that there has been compliance and each of the respondents has tendered unqualified apology which is accepted and the contempt notice is discharged.

for the petitioners. m.k. banerjee, solicitor general, a.k. ganguli, ms. a. subhashini, p. parmeshwaran and b. parthasarthi for the respondents. the following order of the court was delivered: o r d e r an application under article 32 of the constitution being writ petition no. 591 of 1987 has been filed in this court on behalf of 40 employees working in the pension paying office, pokhara in nepal asking for a direction to the union of india to make the services of the petitioners permanent and for further directions in the matter of payment of allowances and other material benefits as payable to similar employees under the union government. notice was ordered on the application on 14th july, 1987, and two weeks ' time was allowed to the respondents for filing their counter affidavit. on 3rd august, 1987, the court directed as follows: \"two weeks are allowed to the respondents for filing a counter affidavit. no further time will be allowed. one week thereafter is allowed for filing rejoiner. put up this matter after three weeks. meanwhile, status quo as on today shall be maintained.\" (underlining is ours). on 7th august, 1987, the court made the following further order: \"issue notice returnable on august 14, 1987. mr. b. parathasarathy accepts the notice for union of india. respondent is directed to file counter affidavit within one week from today. in the meanwhile petitioner no. 9 will not be evicted from the quarter now occupied by him. \" again on 14th august, 1987, the court further directed: 283 \" . petitioner no.9 will be put back in possession of the government quarter if he has already been evicted . \" ultimately on 11th september, 1987, a three judge bench of this court directed: \"petitioner no. 9 will be reinstated in service and he will also have to be put in possession of his quarter forth with.\" on the allegation that the directions of this court in regard to petitioner no. 9 were not implemented, the present contempt proceeding has been initiated on behalf of the petitioners. petitioners have alleged that with the filing of the writ petition, the treatment provided to the petitioners by the establishment has undergone a change and those of the respondents who have local base in nepal have started ill treating the petitioners. several allegations have been made in support of the aforesaid plea. after notice was issued on this petition, the different respondents have filed separate affidavits in return. the indian embassy for nepal is located at kathmandu. the pension paying office is maintained at some distance at a place called pokhara. it is the common case of the parties that the necessity to maintain such an office is linked up with the historical fact that several inhabitants of nepal worked in the indian army under the gorkha regiment. mainly for their convenience this extra territorial establishment is being maintained. some of the petitioners are india based while others are residents of nepal. the establishment at pokhara is under the direct control of an officer attached to the indian embassy styled as officer in charge, indian embassy, pension paying office, pokhara. the ambassador of the indian embassy at kathmandu, being the head of indian government establishments in nepal, has also supervisory jurisdiction over the pay office. respondent no. s, the military and air attache of the indian embassy is the link between the embassy establishment at kathmandu and the said officer in charge at pokhara. respondent no. 3 is the controller of defence accounts who inter alia oversees the disbursement of the pension of the ex army personnel. respondent no. 1 is the union of india through its defence secretary and respondent no. 2 is the secretary of the ministry of external affairs. admittedly both these respondents 284 are based in delhi and have been impleaded being in overall charge of their establishments. shri s.k. bhatnagar, defence secretary, in his affidavit has taken the stand that he was not personally impleaded in the writ petition. only when he was served with notice in the contempt matter he came to know about court 's directions and realised the full implication of the situation when he had a conference with his senior counsel on december 6, 1987. immediate action was taken to ensure appropriate compliance. shri k.p.s. menon, foreign secretary in the ministry of external affairs has also taken the plea that he was not personally impleaded as a party in the writ petition and came to know about the court 's order at the same conference with senior counsel on december 6, 1987, and ensured immediate compliance with court 's directions. both these secretaries to the government have tendered unconditional apology. the third respondent is the controller of defence accounts, central command, meerut. he has taken the stand that petitioner no. 9, shri c.n. dubey, is not an employee of the establishment of the controller of defence accounts at meerut nor is he an employee under his administrative control. according to him, he has no concern with any executive or administrative matter relating to the pension paying office at pokhara. respondent no. 4, the ambassador, was not subjected to the contempt proceedings. respondent no. 5 is the military and air attache of the indian embassy at kathmandu and is in charge of the general administration of the military wing. apart from offering unconditional apology, he has indicated that dubey has been restored to service and he has been provided with residential accommodation and for the period he was out of possession of the official residence, rent by way of compensation has already been ordered to be paid to him. it is clear from the orders made by this court and the facts appearing on the record that the responsibility for implementation of the court 's orders in regard to petitioner no. 9 squarely rested with respondent no. 6, the officer in charge of the pension paying office. he, in his affidavit, has stated that dubey was dispossessed from his residential accommodation on 14th august, 1987, and by then the order of this court dated 7th august, 1987 had not been received by him. that accommodation was given to one krishna bahadur. later dubey has been restored to service, given possession of a similar accommodation as the one from which he was displaced and with a view to giving effect to the spirit of the order of this court, the rent which dubey had paid for private accommodation has been decided to 285 be borne out of government account. his affidavit explains the delay in implementation thus: a \"there has been delay in implementation of the orders of this hon 'ble court due to delay in communication, administrative bottlenecks and for security reasons. it is further stated that we had no intention to flout or disobey the orders of this hon 'ble court but for the reasons beyond our control, the same could not be implemented notwithstanding the fact that we had all intentions to implement the same in the right earnest. the orders have since been implemented, the petitioner has since been reinstated and also given accommodation. the delay in implementing the same may kindly be condoned and we be excused for such delay for which we have tendered an unconditional apology at the outset of this affidavit. \" there is some material which, if probed into further, might have established that respondent no. 6 had the notice of the order of this court before physical dispossession of dubey was effected. as already noticed, there is allegation of adoption of an attitude of resentment by respondent no. 6 or for the matter of that the local officers, when the writ petition was filed in this court. that backdrop, as contended by counsel for the petitioners, perhaps could be taken to supply the motive for the delay in complying with the directions of this court. we have not considered it expedient to probe into the matter further on account of the fact that there has been compliance and each of the respondents has tendered unqualified apology. we would part with the matter by recording our serious concern and disapproval of the growing conduct of parties and public officers in particular of ignoring the directions of the courts and the multiplying instances of confrontation. the court, including the apex one, is a part of the state and is a built in mechanism of the constitution to administer justice in accordance with law. for discharging that duty, the court has got to adopt an attitude of critical assessment of situations connected with litigation brought before it for adjudication. the manner of functioning of the court in accord with the rule of law has to be dispassionate, objective and analytical. the judges who preside over these courts do not act with a sense of superiority; nor do they look down upon others in the community. in order that the system may efficiently work and the purpose for which the courts are established is duly served, it is necessary that everyone within the framework of the 286 rule of law must accept the system, render due obedience to orders made and in the event of failure of compliance, the rod of justice must descend down to punish. we hope and trust that everyone within the system realises this situation and does not unnecessarily get into a confrontation. the apologies tendered by the respondents are accepted and the contempt notice is discharged. respondent no. 6 is directed to pay to the petitioners the costs of the proceedings which are assessed at rs.2,000 within one month.\n",

            " this appeal concerns the question whether the power to create criminal offences granted to her majestys government by section 1 of the united nations act 1946 (the 1946 act) may only lawfully be exercised at or about the time of the relevant resolution by the security council of the united nations which such order is implementing. at the time of the hearing of this appeal, the appellants, forsyth and mabey, were awaiting criminal trial on a number of charges, of which one is an offence of making funds available to iraq contrary to the articles 3(a) and 11(4) of the iraq (united nations sanctions) order 2000 (the order). as a preliminary issue prior to the trial, the appellants sought to establish that the order creating the offence of making funds available to iraq was ultra vires section 1 of the 1946 act. section 1 grants power to the government to implement resolutions of the security council by an executive order without any parliamentary process. the appellants argument was that such a wide executive power could be justified only if the resolutions of the security council were implemented urgently and the power, therefore, must be construed as subject to its being exercised within a very short timescale. in essence, the appellants maintained that unless the power to make an order under the 1946 act is exercised at or about the same time as the relevant security council resolution, that power is lost by the passage of time. the order in question was made 10 years after the relevant resolution. the appellants lost both in the crown court and the court of appeal. the matter came before this court on 6 december 2010 when, at the outset of the hearing, the appellants were granted permission to appeal; at the conclusion of the hearing the appeal was dismissed for reasons to be given later. the present judgment contains those reasons. lord brown delivered the judgment of the court which held that the power conferred on the government by section 1 of the 1946 act cannot be restricted by confining its exercise within an artificially restricted timeframe. the suggested analogy between the case of a v hm treasury which was concerned with proper limits of the content of orders made pursuant to section 1 of the 1946 act and the present appeal seeking to impose limits upon the time within which the power is properly exercisable is false: [9]. unlike the case of a, where hansard needed to be examined to confirm the absence of parliamentary intention to permit fundamental human rights to be overridden, there is no good reason to look behind the actual words of the 1946 act in this case, and indeed a real risk of breaching parliamentary privilege if one does. had parliament intended to confine the order making power to urgent use, one would have expected it to be clearly provided for in the 1946 act: [10] [11]. instead, the 1946 act is entirely silent on the question and indeed provides for a power to vary the existing order without placing any time limitations upon this power of variation: [12]. the history of how the order in the present case came to be made so long after the un resolution it was implementing confirms that it would be inappropriate to limit the exercise of the power conferred by the 1946 act within a restricted timeframe by demonstrating that security council resolutions are not simply one off measures requiring immediate implementation by member states which then recede into history: [18]. \n",

            "the appellants await trial in the crown court at southwark on three counts of an indictment. count two charges them with making funds available to iraq, contrary to articles 3(a) and 11(4) of the iraq (united nations sanctions) order 2000 and section 1 of the united nations act 1946. the particulars of offence allege that the appellants being directors of mabey & johnson ltd, between 1 may 2001 and 1 november 2002, consented to, or connived in, the making of 422,264 available to the government of the republic of iraq, or a person resident in the republic of iraq, by mabey & johnson, without the authority of a licence granted by the treasury. mabey & johnson ltd were in the business of exporting pre fabricated bridges to developing countries and the essential allegation against the appellants is that they consented to the companys entering into an arrangement which facilitated the iraqi governments avoidance of international sanctions by allowing it indirectly to access funds held in a united nations controlled account. the appellants have pleaded not guilty both to that count and to the other two counts, each of false accounting. the appellants have sought to have count two quashed on the basis that the iraq (united nations sanctions) order 2000 (si 2000/3241) was ultra vires section 1 of the united nations act 1946. in essence they say that such an order cannot be made under the 1946 act unless made at or about the same time as the security council resolution which it is implementing is itself made. this order was made 10 years after the relevant resolution. the argument failed before judge rivlin qc, the recorder of westminster, at a preparatory hearing at southwark on 18 june 2010 (conducted pursuant to section 7 of the criminal justice act 1987). it failed again on an interlocutory appeal (brought by leave of the recorder pursuant to section 9(11) of the 1987 act) to the court of appeal (criminal division), (hooper lj, owen and roderick evans jj) on 22 october 2010: [2010] ewca crim 2437. the court of appeal refused leave to appeal but certified two points of law of general public importance: (i) may the power to create criminal offences granted to her majesty in council by section 1 of the united nations act 1946 only lawfully be exercised at or about the time of the relevant security council resolution? (ii) if yes, are articles 3(a) and 11(4) of the iraq (united nations sanctions) order 2000 to the extent to which they create a criminal offence, ultra vires section 1 of the united nations act 1946 given that the relevant security council resolution was adopted in 1990? the matter came before this court on 6 december 2010 when, at the outset of the hearing, the appellants were granted permission to appeal; at the conclusion of the hearing the appeal was dismissed for reasons to be given later. these reasons now follow. it is convenient at once to set out the most material parts of the three instruments here calling for particular consideration, beginning with the security council resolution (scr) referred to in the two certified questions. (1) scr 661 (1990) (scr 661) was adopted by the security council under chapter vii of the un charter on 6 august 1990 (four days after iraq invaded kuwait, an invasion condemned that same day by scr 660 (1990)). the council reaffirmed scr 660; by article 2 they decided to take measures to secure iraqs compliance with it; by article 3 they imposed an embargo on trade with iraq and kuwait; and by article 4 the council: decides that all states shall not make available to the government of iraq, or to any commercial, industrial or public utility undertaking in iraq or kuwait, any funds or any other financial or economic resources and shall prevent their nationals and any persons within their territories from removing from their territories or otherwise making available to that government or to any such undertaking any such funds or resources and from remitting any other funds to persons or bodies within iraq or kuwait, except payments exclusively for strictly medical or humanitarian purposes and, in humanitarian circumstances, foodstuffs. (2) the united nations act 1946 (the 1946 act) provides by section 1(1): if, under article 41 [in chapter vii] of the charter of the united nations . (being the article which relates to measures not involving the use of armed force) the security council of the united nations call upon his majestys government in the united kingdom to apply any measures to give effect to any decision of that council, his majesty may by order in council make such provision as appears to him necessary or expedient for enabling those measures to be effectively applied, including (without prejudice to the generality of the preceding words) provision for the apprehension, trial and punishment of persons offending against the order. (3) the iraq (united nations sanctions) order 2000, made on 13 december 2000 and coming into force on 14 december 2000 (the 2000 order), recites: whereas under article 41 of the charter of the united nations the security council of the united nations have, by a resolution adopted on 6 august 1990, called upon her majestys government in the united kingdom and all other states to apply certain measures to give effect to a decision of that council in relation to iraq: now, therefore, her majesty, in exercise of the powers conferred on her by section 1 of the united nations act 1946, is pleased, by and with the advice of her privy council to order, and it is hereby ordered, as follows. articles 3 and 11 (the two articles referred to in count 2 and in the second certified question) provide: 3. any person who, except under the authority of a licence granted by the treasury under article 5 (a) makes any funds available to the government of the republic of iraq or any person who is resident in the republic of iraq, or, (b) otherwise remits or removes any funds from the united kingdom to a destination in the republic of iraq, is guilty of an offence. 11. (1) any person guilty of an offence under article 3 . shall be liable (a) on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years, or a fine, or both . (4) where a body corporate is guilty of an offence under this order, and that offence is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate or any person who was purporting to act in any such capacity, he, as well as the body corporate, shall be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly. essentially the appellants argument comes to this. the 1946 act was enacted, and the government was thereby permitted to introduce by executive order highly restrictive measures including new criminal offences and sanctions without a parliamentary majority or even parliamentary scrutiny, specifically so as to enable urgent (prompt, hasty, speedy and immediate were other words used by the appellants in the course of argument) action to be taken to implement article 41 un resolutions. urgency alone justifies such wide executive power and the bypassing of the ordinary parliamentary processes and safeguards. the power, therefore, must be construed as subject to there being a need for its immediate exercise and limited, therefore, to its being exercised within a very short time scale. if not exercised at or about the same time as the resolution being implemented, runs the argument, the power is lost by the effluxion of time. the appellants candidly acknowledge that they can find no example of any other power once given expiring by the effluxion of time (absent, obviously, legislation containing express sunset clauses). they submit, however, that, novel as their argument may be, there is support for it to be found in a number of the speeches made during the parliamentary debates leading to the passage of the 1946 act and some support too in the judgments of this court in a v hm treasury [2010] 2 ac 534. principal amongst the passages from hansard relied upon are these: (i) subsection (4) provides that orders in council shall be laid forthwith before parliament, but it excludes the application of a provision in the rules publication act requiring the publication in the london gazette of notice of the proposal to make the order in council for 40 days before the order is made, it being obvious that the urgency with which decisions of the security council must be carried out renders any such notice quite impracticable. (lord jowitt lc, introducing the bill at its second reading in the house of lords: hansard (hl debates), 12 february 1946, col 376. (ii) [the lord chancellor] is fortunate in being able to bring forward a bill to enable this government to do things by order in council which will, i believe, have the complete, unanimous, and enthusiastic support of everybody in this house. if this organisation fails, all fails. if it is to succeed, it must be able to take effective action, and that action must be prompt and immediate. all the world must know that when it takes a decision, all the member states will be prompt and loyal in giving effect to such a decision. for the reasons the noble and learned lord chancellor has given, this method of orders in council is the only effective way by which we can do that. (viscount swinton, supporting the bill at its second reading: hansard (hl debates), 12 february 1946, col 377. (iii) subsection (4) provides that orders in council shall be forthwith laid before parliament, but it excludes the application of a provision in the rules publication act requiring publication in the london gazette of notice of the proposal to make the order in council for 40 days before the order is made. it is evident that that must be so, because, if we are to take action at all in pursuance of a decision by the security council,\n",

            " the respondent was tried for the commission of an offence under section 7 read with section 16(1)(a)(i) of the for selling adulterated ghee. the analysis of the ghee had disclosed that it had a reichert value of only 22 5 whereas the minimum reichert value fixed for uttar pradesh, where the respondent sold the ghee, was 28. the defence of the respondent was that he had obtained the ghee which he sold from jodhpur where the reichert value fixed was only 22 and that the sample must be held not to be adulterated on the basis of the decision of the allahabad high court in state vs malik ram, a.1,r. 1962 all. this decision laid down that a distinction should be made between ghee obtained from cattle in the hill districts and ghee obtained from cattle in the plains and that ghee obtained from the hill districts of u.p. cannot be held to be adulterated if its reichert value was equal to that prescribed for himachal pradesh which is a hilly area. it was the contention of the respondent that his ghee was admittedly pahadi ghee and therefore this decision would apply. the first class magistrate rejected these contentions and convicted him and sentenced him to six months ' r.i. and a fine of rs. 500. on appeal the sessions judge concurred in the findings of the trial court but reduced the sentence. the respondent thereupon filed a criminal revision petition before the high court. the high court agreed with the courts below that the ghee was not jodhpur ghee but it was produced locally. but it held that the reichert values as fixed were not based on any reasonable classification and therefore it was sufficient if a vendor satisfied the minimum standard prescribed for any area in the country and since the minimum prescribed for certain areas is 21 and since the ghee in question had 22 2 the respondent was not guilty of the offence charged. the state thereupon appealed to this court by way of a certificate under article 134(1)(e) of the constitution. it was urged by the appellant that the high court was wrong in striking down or re drafting the rules framed by the central government in the manner in which the high court has done purporting to invoke 680 article 14 of the constitution and virtually setting up what the high court considered was the reasonable standard. held: (i) where the government have prescribed certain standards after taking into considerations various factors the court cannot strike down these standards as unreasonable or discriminatory merely on some priori reasoning. it can do so only by basing its decision on materials placed before it by way of scientific analysis. the party invoking article 14 must make averments with details to sustain such a plea and lead evidence to establish his allegations. in the absence of such plea and evidence the court cannot accept the statement of a party as to the unconstitutionality of a rule and refuse to enforce that rule as it stands merely because in its view the standards are too high and for this reason the rule is unreasonable. (ii) applying these principles it is found that the case state vs malik ram (a.i.r. 1962 all. 156) was wrongly decided by the allahabad high court. in the case under appeal the high court took the matter a step further and adopted the lowest reichert value prescribed for any area in the country as what should be adopted for every other area in the country disregarding the rules. hence the high court was wrong in allowing the revisions. \n",

            "minal appeal no. 164 of 1962. appeal from the judgment and order dated may 2, 1962, of the allahabad high court in criminal revision no. 1579 of 1961. o. p. rana and c. p. lal, for the appellant. harnam singh chadda and harbans singh, for the respondent. february 6, 1964. the judgment of the court was delivered by ayyangar j. this appeal which comes before us on a certificate of fitness granted by the high court of allahabad under article 134(1)(c) of the constitution, is against a judgment of that court acquitting the respondent kartar singh of an offence under section 7 read with section 16 (1)(a) (i) of the which may be conveniently referred to as the act. 681 the facts giving rise to the prosecution are briefly these: the respondent runs a shop at haldwani and among the products sold by him is ghee. on march 19, 1960 a quantity of the ghee was purchased by the food inspector of the area and he put samples of the purchase into three phials which were sealed in the respondent 's presence. it may be mentioned that even in the seizure memo the food inspector noted the ghee purchased by him as \"pahadi ghee\". one of the samples was forwarded to the public analyst to the government of uttar pradesh for analysis forascertaining whether the said ghee was adulterated. the analysis disclosed that in several respects the samplewas sub standard and that in particular it had a reichertvalue of 22 5 as against the prescribed minimum of 28 for ghee in uttar pradesh. after setting out the details of the ana lysis, the public analyst expressed the opinion that the sample \"contained a small proportion of vegetable fat or oil foreign to pure ghee\". on receipt of this report, the medical officer of health, haidwani sanctioned the pro secution of the respondent and a complaint was thereafter laid before the magistrate 1st class by the food inspector. the respondent pleaded not guilty and entered on his defence. subsequently, the second sample was got analysed by the director, central food laboratory, who reported that his analysis disclosed a reichert value of 21 7 as against 22 5 of the public analyst. the opinion expressed by him as regards the sample of ghee which he analysed was the same as that of the public analyst, viz., that the sample was adulterated. the defence of the respondent who admitted that he had sold the ghee, samples of which were the subject of analysis, but denied it was adulterated, was two fold: (1) he had obtained the ghee which he sold from jodhpur, (2) the sample must be held not to be adulterated on the basis of the decision of the allahabad high court in state vs malik ram(1). the plea by the respondent regarding the ghee sold having come from jodhpur was made because if this were established under the rules framed under the act, to which (1) a.i.r. 1962 au. 682 we shall later refer, the minimum reichert value prescribed for ghee in the jodhpur area was 21 and that minimum re quirement was satisfied by the sample analysed. the res pondent led evidence to prove his purchase from jodhpur but the learned magistrate did not accept this case. the other defence was a point of law relying on the decision of a division bench of the allahabad high court reported as state vs malik ram(1). the learned judges who decided that case drew a distinction between ghee obtained from cattle in the hill districts of uttar pradesh and those from cattle in the plains. this decision was relied on by the respondent because the ghee sold by him was noted as 'pahadi ghee ' by the food inspector. the learned judges held that notwithstanding the terms of the rules to which we shall later refer, ghee obtained from hilly areas of uttar pradesh like kumaun hills, could not be held to be adulterated if its reichert value was equal to that prescribed for himachal pradesh which was mostly a hilly area. they therefore held that though the rules under the food adulteration act prescribed a minimum reichert value of 28 for ghee for the entire state of uttar pradesh, still if ghee from hill areas of the uttar pradesh state reached a minimum of 26 reichert value, such ghee would not be \"adulterated ghee\". we shall consider the correctness of this decision after completing the narrative of the proceedings. the learned magistrate held that this decision did not affect the present case because the reichert value of the respondent 's ghee was less than 26.the magistrate therefore convicted the respondent andsentenced him to rigorous imprisonment for a period of sixmonths and a fine of rs. 500 and in default to furtherimprisonment for three months. the respondent preferred an appeal to the sessions judge kumaon, and raised the same pleas and defences as he put forward before the learned magistrate. the sessions judge concurred in the finding of the magistrate regarding the story of the respondent having bought the ghee from jodhpur, and he also agreed with the magistrate about the effect of the decision of the division bench of the high court which was also relied on before him. the (1) a.i.r. 1962 all. 683 sessions judge, however, while upholding the conviction reduced the sentence of imprisonment from six months to one month and the fine to rs. 200. the respondent thereupon filed a criminal revision petition to the high court under sections 435 and 439 of the criminal procedure code. the learned judge of the high court agreed with the courts below on the finding of fact as regards the jodhpur origin of the ghee observing \"as the file stands i am satisfied that this ghee was of local origin\". there was, of course, no point raised before him as regards the correctness of the analysis. 'me learned judge, however, held that the basis on which the reichert value had been prescribed for the several areas in the country was not based on any rational classification and he therefore held that it was sufficient if any vendor of ghee in the country satisfied the minimum standards prescribed for any area under these rules. as there were areas in the country in regard to which a minimum reichert value of 21 had been prescribed, he held that the respondent was not guilty of adulteration and so directed his acquittal. it is from this decision that the present appeal has been filed by the state. before considering the point about the standards prescribed under the food adulteration act being violative of article 14, an article which though not specifically mentioned, is apparently the ground upon which the learned judge has held that the prescription of the reichert value of 28 for uttar pradesh was unenforceable, it would be necessary to set out the statutory provisions on which the decision of the present appeal turns. the preamble to the act describes it as one \"to make provision for the prevention of adulteration of food\". section 2 defines the word 'adulterated ' as follows : \"an article of food shall be deemed to be adulterated (i) if the quality or purity of the article falls below the prescribed standard or its constituents are present in quantities which are in excess of the prescribed limits of variability;\" 684 to read only the portion that is material. section 3 enables the central government to constitute a committee for food standards and it runs \"3.(1) the central government shall, as soon as may be after the commencement of this act, constitute a committee called the central committee for food standards to advise the central government and the state governments on matters arising out of the administration of this art and to carry out the other functions assigned to it under this act. (2) the committee shall consist of the following members, namely: (a) the director general, health services, ex officio, who shall be the chairman; (b) the director of the central food laboratory, ex officio; (c) two experts nominated by the central government; (d) one representative each of the central ministries of food and agriculture, commerce and industry, railways and defence nominated by the central government; (e) one representative each nominated by the government of each state; (f) two representatives nominated by the central government to represent the union territories; (g) two representatives of industry and com merce nominated by the central government; (h) one representative of the medical profession nominated by the indian council of medical reserch\". 685 section 7 which prohibits the manufacture and sale of adulterated food reads: \"no person shall himself or by any person on his behalf manufacture for sale, or store, sell or distribute (i) any adulterated food;. \" section 8 makes provision for state governments appointing public analysts and section 9 for the appointment of food ins pectors. the next material provision is that contained in section 13 which deals with the reports of the analysis of food for the purpose of ascertaining whether there are adulterat ed or sub standard etc. its first sub section directs the public analyst to make a report and under sub section (3) the certificate issued by the director of the central food laboratory under sub section (2) is to supersede the report given by a public analyst under sub section section 16 provides for the penalties for offences under the ' act. section 23 confers on the central government power to make rules but these rules have to be framed after consultation with the committee established under section 3 and among the rules which might be made are section 23(1)(b) defining the standards of quality for, and fixing the limits of variability permissible in respect of, any article of food;. . . \"23. (2) all rules made by the central government under this act shall as soon as possible after they are made be laid before both houses of parliament. \" under the power conferred by section 23, the prevention of food adulteration rules, 1955, were promulgated. rule 5 which occurs in part iii of the rules headed \"definitions and standards of quality\" specifies that \"the standards of quality of the \n",

the correctness of that view is challenged before us by the appellants in the present appeal. the appellants are two brothers, amritlal and mohanlal nagji, and their mother, bai jakal arjan. the three appellants and respondent 2, nagji govind, the father of appellants 1 and 2 and the husband of appellant 3, constitute an undivided hindu family. respondent 2 executed a mortgage deed in favour of respondent 1, jayantilal doshi, in respect of the joint family property for rs. 2,000. this document was executed on february 5, 1946. in 1950, respondent 1 sued respondent 2 on his mortgage, obtained a decree for sale and filed an application for execution for sale of the mortgaged property. sale was accordingly ordered to be held. at that stage the appellants filed the present suit on april 30, 1951, and claimed a declaration that the decree passed in the mortgage suit (civil suit no. 589 of 1949) in favour of respondent 1 and against respondent 2 was not binding in respect of the 3/4th share of the appellants in the mortgaged property; they also asked for a perpetual injunction restraining respondent 1 from executing the said decree in respect of their share. to this suit the mortgagor, respondent 2, was impleaded as a party. in their plaint the appellants have stated that respondent 2 had speculated in gold and silver and had thereby lost a large amount of money which he sought to make up by borrowing amounts from several creditors. one of such creditors was dharsi shamji 844 to whom rs. 2,000 were payable by respondent 2. according to the appellants the impugned mortgage had been executed by respondent 2 for the payment of the said debt of rs. 2,000, and since the said debt was immoral or avyavaharik the appellants were not bound by it. the claim was resisted by both respondent 1 and respondent 2 who pleaded that the mortgage had been executed for the payment of debts which were binding on the family and that there was no substance in the plea of immoral debts raised by the appellants. it was also alleged by them that the mortgaged property was not the property of the undivided hindu family. on these pleadings the trial court framed appropriate issues. it found that the mortgaged property was the coparcenary property of the family, that the mortgage deed in question had been executed to pay off a debt which was immoral and that in consequence the mortgage was not binding against the appellants. according to the trial court the debt contracted by respondent 2 to pay the losses incurred by him in speculative transactions must be held to have been contracted for illegal and immoral purposes and as such the subsequent alienation for the payment of the said debt cannot bind the appellants. the trial court also observed that respondent 1 had not stepped into the witness box to give evidence to show that he had made any enquiries about the existence of any antecedent debts payable by respondent 2. in the result the suit filed by the appellants was decreed. against the said decree respondent preferred. an appeal before the district judge, but the district judge agreed with all the findings made by the trial court and dismissed the said appeal. respondent then took the matter before the high court of saurashtra in second appeal. the high court agreed that the mortgaged property was the property of the joint hindu family and that respondent 1 had made no attempt to prove any enquiry on his part before he entered into the transaction. the high court did not think it necessary to consider whether the antecedent debt due to dharsi shamji, for the repayment of which the impugned 845 mortgage was created, was in law immoral or illegal, it proceeded to deal with the appeal on the assumption that the said debt was illegal or immoral. on that assumption the high court considered the material principles of hindu law and held that it was for the appellants to prove not only that the antecedent debt was immoral or illegal, but also that respondent 1 had, notice of the said character of the debt; and since the appellants had led no evidence to discharge this onus they were not entitled to claim any relief against respondent 1. on this finding the second appeal preferred by respondent was allowed and the suit filed by the appellants was ordered to be dismissed. it is against this decree that the appellants have come to this court by special leave. on behalf of the appellants dr. barlingay has urged that the principles of hindu law do not justify the view taken by the high court that the appellants had to prove the alienee 's knowledge about the immoral character of the antecedent debt. he concedes that the judicial decisions on this point are against his contention; but he argues that there is paucity of case law on the subject, and that, having regard to the importance of the point raised by him, we should examine the true legal position by reference to the texts rather than by reference to judicial decisions. let us then set out the appellant 's argument based on the textual provisions of hindu law. the doctrine of pious obligation under which sons are held liable to discharge their father 's debts is based solely on religious considerations; it is thought that if a person 's debts are not paid and he dies in a state of indebtedness his soul may have to face evil consequences, and it is the duty of his sons to save him from such evil consequences. the basis of the doctrine is thus spiritual and its sole object is to confer spiritual benefit on the father. it is not intended in any sense for the benefit of the creditor. as has been observed by the privy council in sat narain vs das (1) this doctrine \" was not based on any necessity for the protection of third parties but was based on (1) (1936) l.r. 63 i.a. 384, 395. 110 846 the pious obligation of the sons to see their father 's debts paid. \" this doctrine inevitably postulates that the father 's debts which it is the pious obligation of the sons to repay must be vyavaharik. if the debts are not vyavaharik or are a vyavaharik the doctrine of pious obligation cannot be invoked. the expression 'avyavaharik ' which is generally used in judicial decisions has been based on the text of usanas which has been quoted by mitakshara in commenting on the relevant text of yajnavalkya (1). according to usanas, whatever is not vyavaharik has not to be paid by the son. 'na vyavaharikam ' are the words used by usanas, and put in a positive form they mean 'avyavaharik '. colebrooke has translated these words as meaning \" debt for a cause repugnant to good morals \". these words have received different interpretations in several decisions. sometimes they are rendered as meaning \"a debt which as a decent and respectable man the father ought not to have incurred \": darbar khachar vs khachar hansar(2); or, \"not lawful, usual or customary\": chhakauri mahton vs ganga prasad (3) ; or, \" not supportable as valid by legal arguments and on which no right could be established in a court of justice in the creditor 's favour \": venugopala naidu vs ramanathan chetty (4). but it appears that in hemraj vs khemchand (5) the privy council has, on the whole, preferred to treat colebrooke 's translation as making the nearest approach to the real interpretation of the word used by usanas; whatever may be the exact denotation of the word, it is clear that the debt answering the said description is not such a debt as the son is bound to pay, and so as soon as it is shown that the debt is immoral the doctrine of pious obligation cannot be invoked in support of such a debt. in this connection, it has also been urged by dr. barlingay that the onus placed on the sons to prove the immoral character of the debt is already very heavy. in discharging the said onus the sons are required to prove not merely that their father who (1) yajnavalkya, ii, 47. (2) bom. 348, 351 (3) cal. 862, 868, 860. (4) (1912) i.l.r. , 460, (5) i.l.r. [1943] all. 847 contracted the impugned debt lived an extravagant or immoral life but they are required to establish a direct connection between the immorality of the father and the impugned debt. if this onus is made still more onerous by requiring the sons to prove that the alienee had knowledge of the immoral character of the antecedent debt, it would virtually make the sons ' task impossible, and notwithstanding the spirit underlying the doctrine of pious obligation the sons in fact would be compelled to pay the immoral or impious antecedent debt of their father. that is why the rule which requires that the sons should prove the knowledge of the alienee is inconsistent with the basis of the doctrine of pious obligation. thus presented the argument is no doubt simple and prima facie attractive. the question which we have to consider is whether we should attempt the task of examining the texts and determining the true effect of the original provisions of hindu law in spite of the fact that the point raised is covered by judicial decisions which have been treated for many years as laying down the c\n",
