### Define a Business-Specific Evaluation

For our legal summarization service, we propose a **Lawyer Satisfaction Score** that combines:

- **Expert Accuracy Rating**: a panel of senior attorneys reviews a random sample of summaries and assigns a score from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) based on factual completeness and legal nuance.  
- **Key-Facts Coverage**: automated check that each summary includes at least 90 % of predefined “must-have” legal elements (e.g. parties, issue, holding).
